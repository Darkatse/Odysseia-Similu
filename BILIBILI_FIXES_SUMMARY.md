# Bilibili Provider Fixes Summary

## 🎉 All Issues Resolved!

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the Bilibili provider issues in the Odysseia-Similu music bot.

## 📋 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ `page_index 和 cid 至少提供一个` Error
**Problem**: The bilibili-api-python library's `get_download_url()` method requires either `page_index` or `cid` parameter.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `similubot/provider/bilibili_provider.py` line 207
- Changed from: `video.get_download_url()`
- Changed to: `video.get_download_url(page_index=0)`
- Uses the first part (page_index=0) by default for multi-part videos

### 2. ✅ Discord User Interface "获取歌曲信息失败" Error
**Problem**: Discord commands showed error messages instead of success confirmations for Bilibili videos.

**Root Cause**: Missing integration between BilibiliProvider and Discord command system.

**Solution**:
- Added `AudioSourceType.BILIBILI` enum in `similubot/adapters/music_player_adapter.py`
- Updated `detect_audio_source_type()` method to handle Bilibili URLs
- Created `BilibiliClientAdapter` for Discord integration
- Updated music command logic to handle `bilibili` source type
- Updated help documentation to include Bilibili support

### 3. ✅ `'MockMember' object has no attribute 'voice'` Playback Error
**Problem**: When songs from users who left the server were loaded from persistent storage, the playback loop crashed.

**Root Cause**: `MockMember` class in `similubot/queue/song.py` was missing the `voice` attribute that the playback engine tries to access.

**Solution**:
- Added `voice = None` attribute to `MockMember` class
- Added `name` property method for consistent naming
- Updated `Song` class type annotation to accept both `discord.Member` and `MockMember`
- Enhanced playback engine logging to distinguish between "left server" and "not in voice channel"
- Added comprehensive error handling for both MockMember and real Member objects
